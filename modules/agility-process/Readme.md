# About Agility & our process

> *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools
*Working software* over comprehensive documentation
*Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
*Responding to change* over following a plan

Large projects are generally far too complex to be developed in isolation and involve a team of people with various responsibilities and skills, from different departments and, sometimes, even from different organisations.

In this module you will learn some tools, processes and methodologies that can help you become an effective member of any team. For you, individually, the benefits are that you will not only grow more experienced in your craft but you will also gain confidence in interacting with people who are working together towards achieving a common goal. You will learn to interact with co-developers and designers, with project managers, project owners, and other *stakeholders*, and also with the clients who have commissioned Novoda to bring their visions to life.

The most popular strategy to manage a project and its team is the *Agile methodology*. We at Novoda pride ourselves on being agile, meaning that we have the skills and flexibility to adapt to changes in project requirements and resources. Therefore, it is essential that you learn and understand this methodology.

But there is more to our process than just using a methodology. Continuously improving how we work and make communication more efficient is also part of what being Agile means.

That’s why we also want you to learn about time management, getting the most out of your calendar application, your email inbox and other tools we use for productivity enhancement at Novoda. Efficient time and communication management will not only help you and your team when working on a project but will allow you to achieve a good work-life balance.

## Literature

You will once again be asked to read some material on a particular subject - this time, Agility - and perform specific tasks before the module is considered complete. You and your buddy will make a personalised choice among the following books:

- *User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product* by Jeff Patton
- *Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process* by Kenneth Rubin
- *The Nature of Software Development: Keep It Simple, Make It Valuable, Build It Piece by Piece* by Ron Jeffries
- *How to be a Productivity Ninja: Worry Less, Achieve More and Love What You Do*  by
Graham Allcott
- *Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers* by Dave Gray, Sunni Brown, James Macanufo
- *Rolling Rocks Downhill* by Clark Ching
- *Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction* by Chris Sims, Hillary Louise Johnson

Finally go over the archive of H&T videos [novoda.tv](https://novoda.tv/#/discovery) and see if there are any previous topics about ‘self improvement’ that you want to read up on, why not check out the Novoda book-club whilst you’re at it.

## Guidelines

1. You should aim to get first hand experience as part of an agile team: facilitate a retrospective (guild, your project, process within Novoda)
2. Try to understand team dynamics in order to solve a problem: consider to co-facilitate a workshop around anything you find interesting, eg: join one of the Liberating Structures meetups
3. Improve your relation with the productivity tools in order to optimise communication and use time efficiently:  you optimise your tools like Google Calendar, Slack and your email (inbox zero anyone?)
4. You should share back to the team some of your learnings about continuous improvement as H&T or blogpost
