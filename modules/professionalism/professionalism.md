# Module 5

## On professionalism: working with clients and soft skills

Clients will generally have greater knowledge of their brand, target market and domain, while we are likely to have a higher level of expertise in the platform and ecosystem they want to target. To deliver the best end result, we need to harness all of that knowledge and work effectively as a cross-company team. This requires constant communication on the client’s needs, internal demands, potential solutions and trade-offs. Communication is hard. 

As a software crafter you will have developed your knowledge of coding, testing, SDKs and platform specifics. Building on that, we will help you to give effective explanations, use appropriate language for the audience you’re addressing and present written and spoken communications in a positive manner to clients and colleagues. It’s important that you can discuss technical problems together, understand other people's points of view and contribute constructively to meetings.

This module aims to help you build your professional behaviour and communication skills in each of these areas, so you can achieve and maintain the level of professionalism expected of every Novoda employee.

### I. Literature on professionalism

Professionalism and communication in software development is a wide topic. Below we have listed several different books covering the area. Talk to your buddy/mentor about your choice of book as some books cover a different range of ideas or come at the idea of improving professionalism / communication from a different angle and you need to find one that suits and interests you. Feel free to read the others in your own time.

The benefits to both Novoda and you are clear: by becoming a better professional, you’ll be more effective in your communication allowing you to fulfill your potential and create high-quality software products for you and our clients.

*The Clean Coder* by Robert C Martin  
*Driving Technical Change* by Terrence Ryan  
*Getting to Yes: Negotiating an Agreement Without Giving In* by Roger Fisher, William Ury, Bruce Patton  
*Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual* by John Z. Sonmez  
*Non Violent Communication* by Marshall B. Rosenberg  

The activities you’ll need to finish in order to complete this module are:

* Read one of the literature selection  
* Organise a roleplay workshop to prove skills  
* Give a H&T presenting on one idea of professionalism or communication  

Within the books, there are many skills and ideas for behaviour. We want you to run a session where you get participants to roleplay different personas, in order for a skill to be explained and for practice of how you should react. The session can have 2 or 22 participants it is up to you. This is a very flexible task and the main goal is for you to put some of your learning about behaviour and communication into practice in a safe environment. If you have other ideas of how to do this, discuss them with your buddy/mentor and make it happen.

### II. Reflect on your past behaviour


A big part of improving any personal skill is self-reflection. It’s important to look objectively at how you handled a situation in the past, consider how you could improve your approach and potentially generate a better outcome from similar situations in the future. 

Working at Novoda we have a lot of practices that require excellent communication skills and all of us are constantly learning and trying to improve these. We’ve identified common scenarios where communication issues can occur. Consider these in the context of your own experience, thinking about how you might adapt your approach and develop your communication skills in the future.


#### Giving constructive feedback on pull requests  

It’s easy to fall into bad habits when reviewing pull requests. Avoid overly abrupt or negative comments like “That’s wrong”, “Don’t do that”, “Why would you do that?”, “No”. Consider whether that accurately reflects the tone of voice you are intending to portray and how that might feel to the person receiving the feedback.   
Instead, try to explain what you see as the problem with the code, why this might be an issue and provide an alternative solution. Adding links to StackOverflow answers, blog posts or articles are a great way to support your comments and provide more useful feedback. Another productive method of giving feedback is to pose it as a question, or at least think of it in that context first. For example, rather than saying “This class is badly designed”, consider the point as “Does the composition of this class adequately reflect the single responsibility principle?” Once you have considered the point in this way, it may help you to write your comment in a more objective light.  
It can also be very productive to pair with the person who made the pull request to explain things in more detail, especially if you have a better understanding of the techniques you are explaining than they do.

It’s also always worth keeping in mind two things:
Everyone has the best intentions. No-one intends to write bad code and any criticism should be intended to help the author to improve.
Everyone writes code with the best information they have at the time. It’s easy to criticise an older codebase but you may not be aware of the context and reasoning for decisions that were made at the time. It’s your responsibility as a good software craftsperson to put yourself in their shoes. This will give you better insight into your own current challenges.


#### Discussing a technical problem  
It’s important to discuss technical issues in an open and objective way with respect for alternative opinions. There may be multiple solutions to a problem that are all worth discussing and considering carefully before reaching a decision on the best approach. Ensure you always keep the big picture in mind and consider any constraints that may impact the project. Everyone is passionate about what they do and the things they are creating, but we should not let that blind us to the advantages and disadvantages of each solution. Don’t forget we are all striving together to deliver the highest quality output for our clients. 
 
#### Speaking with colleagues
When having a conversation we need to be mindful of how our words will be interpreted. Sometimes we say things in haste or with a previous conversation in mind. It is very important not to talk down to people and to treat everyone with the respect you yourself want to be treated with. We all have the same aims and all want to achieve the same outcome, nobody ever intentionally messes things up or makes things awkward for you on purpose. It is important in conversation to explain exactly what you mean but also to be aware of the knowledge of the other person. Instead of saying “this is all wrong” ask “do you know why it was done this way?

#### Speaking with clients
Be aware that everyone you speak to is not technically minded. It is important to consider who is in a conversation when you start to explain a scenario or an issue. Explaining the intricacies of nuclear fusion as to why the cleaners can’t go into the reactor doesn’t help avoid radiation poisoning. Better to be conscious of who you are talking to and converse at a level that everyone understands and more importantly everyone gains value from the conversation. You shoot yourself in the foot if you want to do a certain piece of work and really enjoy its technical elegance, so you talk about the implementation details of how it will work to the client to impress them, rather than explaining at a high level and saying it will bring X% more users. Which explanation do you think the client is more likely to sign off on? Being conscious of what you say, and the tone / lingua you use is an excellent skill for any professional.

Proposing alternatives (aka saying no)
We should always strive to achieve a client’s goals, which sometimes involves understanding their underlying need rather than what they ask for. For instance, a client might request “a homepage that is automatically refreshed with our latest data from the web, can you poll the server every 5 minutes to get this data and keep the screen up to date?” As a professional, you first response should be “Yes,” closely followed by “however the best solution to keep the screen up to date is to use push notifications as that has the advantage of not draining the battery”. You have implicitly said no to the client’s bad suggestion, but from the client’s perspective they’re still getting what they want.

It’s easy to respond with “No” when you hear something that you don’t agree with, but it’s always worth taking a few seconds to reflect on who is speaking, the role that person is fulfilling, what they really want and how we can help them achieve it. Then start your response with a “Yes”.
    
Considering the above points, please complete this task:  
Reflect on your own behaviour and think of scenarios where one or more of the above may have arisen
Try to be mindful of the situation around you, try to categories the scenario and recognise how you can change your behaviour to improve the conversation 
Write a blog post or give a H&T showing the importance of one of the above skills
